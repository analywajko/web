        <h2 style="color: blue">Who is Queen?</h2>
        <p style="color: blue">
        Queen was a very propular British band from the 70's and 80's. They were well known for their wide range of music, as well as their iconic performance at Live Aid in 1985. The band was made up of four members, a bassist, guitarist, drummer, and a vocalist. Perhaps their most well known song, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>, is still very well known, and impacts society. They had a lot of impact on other aritsts and have won countless awards.

        <h2 style="color: darkmagenta">Info on each of the members</h2>
        <p style="color: darkmagenta">
        Queen was initially started as the band "Smile", in 1969. The band consisted of members Brian May (guitarist), Roger Taylor (drummer), and lead singer Tim Staffell. The band dissolved when Staffell thought it was going nowhere. May and Taylor didn't want to give up on their dreams, and recruited Freddie Mercury to be the lead singer in 1970. A year later, in 1971, John Deacon (bassist) joined, and they adopted the name "Queen". After almost 20 years of success, Mercury died in 1991 of AIDS related complications. More recently, May and Taylor have hired Adam Lambert to replace Mercury as lead vocalist, and have toured with Lambert around the world. Unfortunately, Deacon retired after Mercury's death.

        <h2 style="color: crimson">My opinions on their albums</h2>
        <p style="color: crimson">
        The band came out with 15 studio albums over a course of 23 years. The first album being <u>Queen</u> (1973), and the last being <u>Made in Heaven</u> (1995). Interestingly, their last album was released four years after Mercury's death, but still featured his vocals from previously unfinished songs. My favorite album, and probably their best, is <u>A Night at the Opera</u> (1975). The album is full of some of their greatest hits, and is even featured on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/arcade-fire-%ef%bb%bffuneral-1062733/">Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Best Albums List</a>. All in all, their discography is great and there are hardly any bad songs.
